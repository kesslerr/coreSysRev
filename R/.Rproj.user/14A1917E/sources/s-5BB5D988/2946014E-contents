#' Contrast coding for HLM
#'
#' We use contrast coding to get a useful, nice-to-interpret intercept in our model. 
#' We want the intercept to be equivalent to the "mean of all subjects from all studies".
#' With usual coding of the factor "Study", the overall intercept of the model would be equvalent to the mean of study #1.
#' does a keyword search over the headers to find those column headers that
#' match a particular keyword, e.g., mean, median, etc.
#' Therefore, we create artificial variables according to: https://pagepiccinini.com/2016/03/18/contrast-coding-with-three-level-variables/
#' For two variables, contrast coding is straightforward.
#' For three variables, keep in mind, that interpretation of some other model parameters may change (c.f. website above).
